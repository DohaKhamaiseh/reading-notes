# In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python
## Key Principles of TDD :
1. ### Test the things that will help you feel confident about your code.
2. ### Test one thing and assert many.
3. ### Write tests before code.
4. ### Review tests as you do code.


# If name equals main
### *used in Python scripts to separate the code that will be executed when the script is run directly from the code that will be executed when the script is imported as a module in another script.*

### Use Cases :
  1. ### Testing : test code in the script that is only executed when the script is run directly.
  2. ### Standalone Execution : to include code when  the script is run directly, but not when it is imported as a module.

# Recursion 
### *The Recursion is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly, it is essential to  provide a certain case in order to terminate the recursion process. used to reduce the length of the code and make it easier to read and write.*

# Python Modules and Packages
### *The module is a single file containing Python definitions and statement while the Package is a a collection of related modules that are organized in a directory hierarchy.*

### Model : 
1.  create a script file
2. write inside it what you want
3. write "import script file name"  in the main script
4. Now you can call any variables. functions, classes, from the script file

### Package :
1. create a folder
2. put inside it multiple script files
3. write code on each script file
4. write "import folder name.script file1 name , folder name.script file2 name"  in the main script
5. Now you can call any variables. functions, classes, from the script files
