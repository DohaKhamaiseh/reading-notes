## The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars

This article about self-driving cars doesn't fully address the ethical challenges we're facing. Here are some of the main points and questions it raises:

1. The first part of the article talks about Germany's proposal. The idea is that autonomous cars should always try to avoid causing harm to humans and shouldn't discriminate based on age, gender, or any other factor. But what happens when a car has to choose between a child and an adult, or a child and an elderly person? Who should it prioritize? These questions make us consider our ethical values.

2. Next, the article suggests that passengers might have more control over their car's settings, including routes and preferences. But, imagine a situation where the car would definitely cause harm to either a man or a woman. If I, as a passenger, can decide who gets hurt, is that morally right? This question examines our personal biases and the ethics of choice.

On a broader level, two main questions arise:

1. How should a self-driving car decide whom to save and whom to harm in the event of an unavoidable accident?

2. If a self-driving car ends up causing harm, who should be held responsible?

- The article points out that if self-driving technology is going to benefit society, we need to solve these ethical issues soon. I agree with this but think it's important that we address these questions before self-driving cars become more common.

- Finally, the article draws a comparison between the feeling of control people have over their phones and the control they might have over self-driving cars. While there's some truth in this, we must remember that the consequences with cars can be physically harmful, which is not the case with phones. This difference is crucial and should be kept in mind when discussing control over autonomous technology.
