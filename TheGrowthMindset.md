### I think all of us need to know how to have a Growth Mindset because development is the key to being a professional developer and if a developer doesn't believe in Growth  will make him/her stuck in naive Technical  thoughts  

## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice :
 *I thought before reading it, it will talk about practicing more and more until the developer becomes professional, but it talked about something else, the main thing it talked about, was this: You know you've upgraded your skills if you're mentally exhausted after a technical challenge. and this skills upgrading is called deliberate practice*

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset :
*it was great what she mentioned about 'yet' and 'not yet' concepts, and how the growth mindset changes children's lives, but I disagree with her when she called that when low-quality education students  get new amazing scores equality, she meant equality with high-quality education students because the students from the two classes starting the race from two different points, even when they reached the end at same time*

##  Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit :
*She talked about the effects of possessing grit, and the one of tools to have it is to know the concept of a growth mindset which was developed by Carol Dweck,  which we mentioned before*

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success :
*he redefines success to accept that we will not succeed in all that we want, and before looking for success make sure that the things that you wanna be succeeded in it are your own, not others' own. By the way, I highly recommend recommended to read his book: Status Anxiety which was translated into arabic as قلق السعي إلى المكانة He mentioned all ideas from the video in detail*

##  your emotional intelligence :
*as an introvert, I sit with myself usually and because of that, I know myself, my thoughts, and my feelings clearly, so getting a high score on the assessment was expected for me, that doesn't mean I see myself perfect but means that I always work on those areas of me*

## your biases :
*I try always to put my bias beside and understand others' points of view by asking them a lot about their backgrounds, I will not lie, sometimes my bias take the action, and if it happens I apologize immediately, the assessment showed that I need to work on some areas and I will do*
