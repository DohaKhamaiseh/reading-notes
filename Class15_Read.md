### Create a vocabulary/definition list

**Node** : A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes

**Root** : The root is the node at the beginning of the tree

**K** : A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

**Left** : A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

**Right** : A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

**Edge** : The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

**Leaf** : A leaf is a node that does not have any children

**Height** : The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

**Width** : The maximum number of nodes in a level

**Depth First** : Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first  :
  * Pre-order: root >> left >> right
  * In-order: left >> root >> right
  * Post-order: left >> right >> root

**Breadth First** : Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

**Binary Tree** : Restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).


**K-ary Tree** : Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, number of children = k

**Binary Search Tree** : Nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
