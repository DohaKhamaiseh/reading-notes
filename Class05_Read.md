## Big O :

### WHAT
 *is a way used to describe the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing its job.*

### WHY
 *because it allows us to compare the efficiency of different algorithms and determine which algorithm is more efficient for a given problem.*

### HOW 
*analyzing the algorithm and determining the number of operations it performs as the input size grows. We then express this as a function of the input size and simplify the function by ignoring lower-order terms and constants.*

## Linked Lists:


### WHAT
*A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.*

### WHY
*because it efficiently inserts and deletes elements in the middle of the list without having to shift elements around.*

### HOW 
* To insert a new node into the list, we create a new node and update the pointers of the surrounding nodes to point to the new node. 
* To delete a node from the list, we update the pointers of the surrounding nodes to skip over the node we want to delete. 
* Traversing a linked list involves following the pointers from one node to the next until we reach the end of the list or the node we are looking for.
