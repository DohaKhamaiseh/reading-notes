## What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?
### Featuers :
1. Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

2. Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

3. Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

4. Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.

### Difference : 
JupyterLab enables us to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks

## What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a powerful library for Python that provides support for multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Here are some of the main functionalities provided by NumPy:

###  Functionalities:


1. Arrays: NumPy provides an array data structure that is more efficient than Python's built-in list data structure. NumPy arrays are homogeneous (i.e., they contain elements of the same type) and have a fixed size, which allows for fast and efficient operations.

2. Mathematical functions: NumPy provides a large collection of mathematical functions that operate on arrays, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic and exponential functions, and more.

3. Random number generation: NumPy provides functions for generating random numbers and random arrays, which can be useful in simulation and modeling tasks.

4. Broadcasting: NumPy allows operations between arrays with different shapes and sizes, using a concept called broadcasting, which makes it easier to work with multidimensional arrays.

### How can it be useful in Python programming?
NumPy is particularly useful for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks because it provides fast and efficient array operations and mathematical functions that can handle large amounts of data.

## Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

### Structure: 
NumPy arrays are homogeneous multidimensional arrays, meaning that all elements in an array have the same data type and size. They can have any number of dimensions (or axes) and can be created from a variety of data sources, including lists, tuples, and other arrays.

### Properties: 
Some of the key properties of NumPy arrays include their shape, size, and data type. The shape of an array refers to its dimensions, while the size refers to the total number of elements in the array. The data type of an array determines the type of elements it can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or complex numbers.

```
import numpy as np

# one-dimensional array
arr1d = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# two-dimensional array
arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

arr1_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2_1d = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(arr1_1d + arr2_1d)  
[5, 7, 9]

arr1_1d.shape()
(1,3)

arr2_1d.sum()
15
