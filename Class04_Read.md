### I think we need the Pytest fixtures to prevent duplicate the common  objects or resources that are needed for testing, for each unit test, also we need the Code coverage to make sure that our test units covered all code cases

## What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?
*Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.*

## Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
*A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.
This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.*

*Example:*
```
def factorial_recursive(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)
```
*Best Practices:*
1. Decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem
(Recursive Case)
2. As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they can be solved without further subdivision(Base Case)

## What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
***Pytest fixtures** allow us to set up and tear down common objects or resources that are needed for testing. Fixtures can be used to set up a database connection, create test data, initialize configuration settings, or any other task that is necessary for testing but not specific to any individual test.*

***Code coverage** is a measure of how much of our codebase is executed during testing. Code coverage analyze our codebase and report on which lines of code were executed during testing and which were not.*

*By using **fixtures**, we can ensure that our tests are properly set up and tear down, reducing the likelihood of test failures and making it easier to write new tests in the future.*

*By increasing our **code coverage**, we can ensure that all the functionality in our codebase is tested and that our tests are comprehensive.*
