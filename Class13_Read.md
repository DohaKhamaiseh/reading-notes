### Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

#### Concept:

*Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. In a simple linear regression model, there is only one independent variable and one dependent variable, and the goal is to find the best line that represents the relationship between the two variables.*


#### Purpose:
The purpose of linear regression in the context of machine learning and data analysis is to identify the relationship between the input variables (also known as features) and the output variable (also known as the target). By fitting a linear equation to the observed data, we can make predictions about the target variable based on the input variables.

### Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

```
# Import the packages and needed classes :
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a numpy array of data:
x = np.array([6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56]).reshape((-1, 1))
y = np.array([4, 23, 10, 12, 22, 35])

# Create an instance of a linear regression model and fit it to the data with the fit() function:
model = LinearRegression().fit(x, y) 

# The following section will get results by interpreting the created instance: 

# Obtain the coefficient of determination by calling the model with the score() function, then print the coefficient:
r_sq = model.score(x, y)
print('coefficient of determination:', r_sq)

# Print the Intercept:
print('intercept:', model.intercept_)

# Print the Slope:
print('slope:', model.coef_) 

# Predict a Response and print it:
y_pred = model.predict(x)
print('Predicted response:', y_pred, sep='\n')

```

### What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?


#### Purpose:

*In statistics and machine learning, we usually split our data into two subsets: training data and testing data (and sometimes into three: train, validate, and test), and fit our model on the train data, in order to make predictions on the test data*

#### How:

*It helps us to build better models by measuring their performance on unseen data.*
